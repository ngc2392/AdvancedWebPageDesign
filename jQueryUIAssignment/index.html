    Parts of a Computer

              <p>The CPU is one of the most important parts of a computer.  There multiple parts 
                  to this part.

                        <h3>The Scheduler</h3>

                        <div>
                            <p>The scheduler takes incoming instructions from the memory and decodes them.  It sends the data to other parts the system which will then execute the instruction.  On a multi-core CPU, there is a scheduler in each core as well as a thread dispatcher that overssees each individual scheduler.  These instructions are read from an instruciton cache, which reads instructions from the RAM.   
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>ALU</h3>

                        <div>
                            <p>The Arithmetic Logic Unit is what does all of the math.  Surprisingly, it only does integer math.  This may come as a suprise since the kinds of calculations a computer can do in such small amounts of time is mind blowing.  The ALU only has instructions that tells it how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide integers, as well as instrucitons to compare them.</p>

                            The FPU, or Floating Point Unit is the companion to the ALU.  Click <span id="opener-fpu">here</span> if you want to learn more about it.

                                <p>The FPU does floating-point math.  Floating-point is a way to represent decimals in computers.</p>

                        <div>
                            A register is a small bit of memory that is used to store a number that is currently being operated on by one of the CPUs other components.  CPUs typically have dozens of registers.  Some are deisgned for special purposes.
